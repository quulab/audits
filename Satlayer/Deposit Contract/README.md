### Severity Matrix

|        Severity        | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| :--------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|  **Likelihood: High**  |   Critical   |      High      |   Medium    |
| **Likelihood: Medium** |     High     |     Medium     |     Low     |
|  **Likelihood: Low**   |    Medium    |      Low       |     Low     |

#### Impact
- **High** - results in a considerable risk that may jeopardize the protocol's overall integrity, impacting all or the majority of users.
- **Medium** - results in a non-critical risk for the protocol, impacting either all users or a specific subset, yet remaining unequivocally unacceptable.
- **Low** - losses incurred will be within acceptable limits, attack vectors can be fixed with relative ease.

#### Likelihood
- **High** - highly probable, presenting significant financial opportunities for exploitation by malicious actors.
- **Medium** - still relatively probable, although contingent upon certain conditions.
- **Low** - requires a unique set of conditions and presents a cost of execution that does not yield a favorable ratio of rewards for the individual involved.

## Findings

### [L-01] Griefing by frontrunning `withdraw()` and `migrate()` methods

#### Description
Malicious user can frontrun [withdraw()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L71) and [migrate()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L86) methods causing DoS for a user who wants to withdraw or migrate a stake.

Example:
1. User A stakes 100 stake tokens and gets 100 receipt tokens
2. User A tries to [withdraw()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L71) or [migrate()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L86) 100 stake tokens
3. User B (malicious) buys 100 receipt tokens on a secondary market, frontruns User A's transaction and withdraws or migrates stake tokens for himself
4. At his point [SatlayerPool](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol) has 0 stake token balance hence User A's transaction will revert with "out of funds"

#### Recommendation
Refactor the code to forbid users without a stake to call [withdraw()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L71) and [migrate()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L86) methods.

### [L-02] Receipt tokens can be stuck in the `SatlayerPool` contract

#### Description
Consider an example:
1. Owner adds a new stake token (`STK`) and a corresponding receipt token `RCT_0`
2. Owner adds `RCT_0` receipt token as a stake token
3. User stakes 100 `STK` tokens setting the [_for](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L53) parameter to the `SatlayerPool` contract which gets 100 `RCT_0`
4. Those 100 `RCT_0` are stuck in the contract since [recoverERC20()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L189) reverts with the `TokenAlreadyAdded` error

        satlayerPool.recoverERC20(satlayerPool.tokenMap(address(stakeToken)), owner, 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

#### Recommendation
In the [addToken()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L138) method validate that added token is not a receipt token.

### [L-03] Some "weird" ERC20 tokens are not supported

#### Description
There are [many](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) "weird" ERC20 tokens which behave differently from "standard" ERC20 tokens. For example, some have fees on transfer while others are able to rebase token balances.

Some of those tokens should not be used as a deposit token in the [SatlayerPool](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol) contract because it leads to DoS or unexpected behavior.

For example, ERC20 tokens with callbacks (like `ERC777`) will allow to circumvent the [cap limit](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L57) while pausable tokens and tokens with blacklist functionality will DoS users' withdrawals.

Here's the list of compatibility between the `SatlayerPool` contract and "weird" ERC20 tokens:

#### Recommendation
If you plan to add a new deposit token make sure it's compatible with the current `SatlayerPool` contract.

---

### [L-04] When `approve()` returns false the contract should revert

#### Description
The interface of this [approve()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L101) method returns `false` in case approval failed. Not all ERC20 tokens revert on failed approval so it makes sense to check the return value and revert in case it is `false`.

#### Recommendation
Revert in case the [approve()](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/SatlayerPool.sol#L101) method returned `false`.

---

### [L-05] The `_decimals` property should be immutable

#### Description
The [_decimals](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/ReceiptToken.sol#L13) property should be marked as `immutable` in order to save gas.

#### Recommendation
Mark the [_decimals](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/ReceiptToken.sol#L13) property as `immutable`.

---

### [L-06] Error not used

#### Description
The [TokenAlreadyConfiguredWithState](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/interface/ISatlayerPool.sol#L18) error is not used anywhere, remove it.

#### Recommendation
Remove the [TokenAlreadyConfiguredWithState](https://github.com/satlayer/deposit-contract-public/blob/1dd233d6dda3991234bc5ed6e0477b22a2570e04/src/interface/ISatlayerPool.sol#L18) error.

The protocol for which this report is prepared indemnifies QuuLab from any liability concerning potential misbehavior, bugs, or exploits affecting the audited code throughout the entirety of the project's life cycle. It is also crucial to recognize that any modifications made to the audited code, including remedial measures for the issues outlined in this report, may inadvertently introduce new complications and necessitate further auditing.

## About QuuLab
QuuLab is a Web3 security firm specializing in advanced formal verification tools and comprehensive smart contract audits. Using modern formal verification tools, we identify even the most elusive and intricate bugs within smart contracts and mathematically prove their absence. We integrate formal verification into the standard deployment pipelines of the audited protocols. It helps developers of the audited protocols to reduce the number of bugs in already audited pieces of code, thereby reducing costs for future security assessments.
